Autumn Equinox officially brought us into fall! Our family moved into town last November, so we've been able to explore some local fall festivities - including Bear Wallow's festival and Haney's fried apple pies - but this year we're expanding our list to hit a few more spots! 

I'll be sure to post reviews and more info as we make our visits. In the meantime, here's a cheat sheet for each location!

# Fall Farm Festivals 
## Bear Wallow 
Open Weekends Sept. 16th - Oct. 29th  
Sat. 10am-9pm & Sun. 1pm-6pm

Bear Wallow is such a fun place to take the family! Tons of activities to keep kiddos busy, and tasty treats to keep everyone fed while you're there. 

Featuring:     
🍂 Pumpkin Patch  
🍂 Photo Backdrops   
🍂 Corn Maze     
🍂 Petting Zoo

I haven't been to Quail Run yet! But we're planning a trip this fall. A smaller operation than Bear Wallow, but I don't doubt that the kiddos will have plenty of fun.

# Fried Apple Pies at Haney's 
Open Daily  
Mon.-Sat. 9:00-5:00  
Sun. 1:00-5:00  

It's officially apple season! 

You used to be able to go apple picking at Haney's, but I have it on good authority they no longer offer PYO apples. 

That said, Haney's is so fun to shop at - they have some amazing merch, and they make the absolute best fried apple pies 🥟

This year, they've also commissioned an AWESOME mural which would make for some great fall family photos. 

Featuring:     
🍂 Bakery  
🍂 Restaurant  
🍂 Shopping  
🍂 Photo Backgrounds  
🍂 Fall Scenic views of the Apple Farm

We love our trips to Cumberland Falls, and the area is a must see in fall colors.
