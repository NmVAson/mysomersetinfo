Hi ðŸ‘‹ We're the Taylors!

Our family recently moved to Somerset, my husband's hometown, to be closer to his family. 

Since we've moved back to town, I've loved discovering the town's events and local secrets, and wanted to find a space to document it all.  

I've been doing a bunch of research for our out-of-town visiting family and friends, and I've compiled a pretty big list of classic Somerset restaurants, shops, and seasonal favorites.  

Putting it out into the world for other families!
